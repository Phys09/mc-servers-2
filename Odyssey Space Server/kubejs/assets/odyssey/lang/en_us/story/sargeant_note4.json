	"Commander, you just can't trust some people.",
	"How did I get here? Well, that friend I was telling you about, snagged my PK-90 and tossed me out his airlock into the waters of L'Borean. I splashed down, hard and got tangled up in some sea kelp, which was actually pretty lucky for me. You see, these manatee type critters was circling me. I was able to lure one closer and fed him some kelp. Seems he grew a like'n to me and even let me ride him.",
	"As we breached the surface, my datacom began to blink and sputter, which drew the attention of a large water dragon. The beast chased me and was much quicker than my manatee friend. I had only one choice. I threw the datacom, which the beast chased and swallowed.",
	"The manatee and I swam for a long while, and I guess I musta fell asleep. I woke up on a bed in a ship of a troll-like alien fisherman who was on his way here, Gardencia. The fisherman told me of a way to get my datacom back. There are stories of an item that summons the beast from its lair. The one time this object was found, was by a fisherman on his hooks. So, we fish for the item, call the beast from his lair and gut him. Then we can get back to Overworld."
