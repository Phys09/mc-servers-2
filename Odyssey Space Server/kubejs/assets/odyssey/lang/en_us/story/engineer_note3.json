	"It seems these energies can also be used to power a number of devices, as one such device I found, was able to produce a random rune from a blank rune. I figured it was as good a place as any to hide my datacom, so I rigged the thing to produce my datacom if one used a life rune on it while holding a power rune. I tell ya what, you go get my datacom, I'll head back to the Gorbs and get my other things."
