	"Of all the stupid things that could go wrong, running for my life, aliens shooting at me, whole ship blowing up, its a freaking leak in the bio-waste dump that takes me out. Yep, my poop went straight through the high-tech space toilet and I leaked atmosphere. Had to make an emergency landing here. I thought I would land safely on the stone top soil, but I just crashed though into an intricate cave system.", 
	"I found a village a short distance from my crash site; Gorbs they call themselves and lucky for me, they had a munitions expert and their own engineer. I thought, THOUGHT, things were looking up, but the minute you think they are, that's when it all goes to hell in a handbasket.",
	"I was working on the pooper when one of them little Gorbs grabs my bag and dashes off. Yep, the bag with my datacom. Can't let that fall into anyone's hands, wrong or not. I saw the little bugger dash off down the path towards a strange blue wall. I've left this message in case I don't come back. You might find me near of these strange blue walls."
