	"I hope this works. I've never had to use the interstellar satellite broadcast system. If anyone on the crew of the Odyssey hears this, then know I am safe for now. My pod was hit by schrapnel and I crashed here, though I'm not sure where here is. The pod is unsalvagable, at least to my knowledge. I  will attempt to find a way to the rendezvous. I have secured my datacom in my pack for now.",
	"I noticed some anomalies in the rocks as I crashed through. Maybe, I can find some useful resources there, through its quite dark. There is faint light coming from the rocks. I've never heard of photosynthetic or bioluminescent rocks. Its quite fascinating. I've heard and seen a few locals around, maybe they'll know more. One was geared, head to toe, in an orange-ish armor. I'm wondering what metal that is."
