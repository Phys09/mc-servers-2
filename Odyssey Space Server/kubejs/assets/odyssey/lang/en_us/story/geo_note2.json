	"Once again, to any of the crew of the Odyssey, I'm safe. For now. As soon as I left the light of my crashed pod, I was surrounded by these creatures. One bit a hole in my pack and most of my things fell out. But that was fortunate, as I had forgotten I had flares and upon seeing one, I lit it up and the creatures fell back. My datacom was damaged during the fight. I hope that Mr. Michaels will be able to repair it. He can fix anything.",
	"I met an interesting fellow, a master of his art. Apprently, he can filter valuables from the lava itself. I believed that nothing survived in lava, that it was just molten rock, minerals and materials molded together. But he was able to separate the items from the molten rock.",
	"He mentioned another realm, one made of geological crystals where one can change these crystals into another form. Imagine, turning glass into diamonds. He is set to return to Crystevia on the morrow and seeing as how there isn't much for me here, I intend to go with him. Maybe, I can find a way back to Overworld and send help.",
