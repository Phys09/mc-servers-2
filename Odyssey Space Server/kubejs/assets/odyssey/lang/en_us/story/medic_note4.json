I even found a Guide and with his help, I was able to chart a path to a planet where I could rest and recover my sanity. A planet with sunshine and radiance called the Shyrelands. Sounds like something from a Tolkien book. I was able to get a patch for my windshield from the merchant put he informed me that the denizens there are not at all friendly either.",
