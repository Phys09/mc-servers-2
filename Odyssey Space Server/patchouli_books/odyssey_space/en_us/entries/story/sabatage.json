The Sargeant, PK-90 in ready position, was behind cover. $(br2)I saw no one run past me so our intruder had slipped past us. I pulled my trusty sidearm, Stampede, and we continued the sweep."

As I ran to the control console in engineering bay, I saw an escape pod released out the port window. It was not of Overworld design. Perhaps it was attached to the ship, cloaked, and scanner couldn't read it. $(br2)But that was a problem for another time."
